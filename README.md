EduPred

EduPred is a browser-based application developed using the Python language with the Streamlit library. EduPred is a development of advanced final grade prediction based on features that are significantly related to a student's study process. The success rate of a student can be calculated with high accuracy. In its use, the user can determine the parameters freely until the model and scaler can also be selected independently to get optimal results. EduPred is designed to fulfill the final project in the Machine Learning course.
